A data frame with 113 rows and 4 variables:
\describe{
  \item{affordability}{Index of food affordability.}
  \item{availability}{Index of food availability.}
  \item{safety}{Index of food quality and safety.}
  \item{resilience}{Index of natural resources and resilience.}
}
}

The original indicator variables consist of 27 variables. Then,
they are summarized into four pillars of food security; they are
affordability, availability, quality and safety, and natural resources
and resilience. Food-security expertise panelists evaluate the score of
each country from 0 to 100, where 0 is the least favorable towards food
security.
