\title{Co-occurrence distance for binary/ categorical variables data}
\usage{
cooccur(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A matrix or data frame of binary/ categorical variables
(see \strong{Details}).}
}
\value{
Function returns a distance matrix (n x n).
}
\description{
This function calculates the co-occurrence distance proposed
by Ahmad and Dey (2007).
}
\details{
This function computes co-occurrence distance, which is a binary/
categorical distance, that based on the other variable's distribution
(see \strong{Examples}).  In the \strong{Examples}, we have a data set:

\tabular{lrrr}{
object \tab x \tab y \tab z \cr
1 \tab 1 \tab 2 \tab 2 \cr
2 \tab 1 \tab 2 \tab 1 \cr
3 \tab 2 \tab 1 \tab 2 \cr
4 \tab 2 \tab 1 \tab 2 \cr
5 \tab 1 \tab 1 \tab 1 \cr
6 \tab 2 \tab 2 \tab 2 \cr
7 \tab 2 \tab 1 \tab 2
}

The co-occurrence distance transforms each category of binary/ categorical
in a variable based on the distribution of other variables, for example,
the distance between categories 1 and 2 in the x variable can be
different to the distance between categories 1 and 2 in the z
variable. As an example, the transformed distance between categories 1 and 2
in the z variable is presented.

A cross tabulation between the z and x variables with
corresponding (column) proportion is

\tabular{rrrrrr}{
\tab 1 \tab 2 \tab ||\tab 1 \tab 2 \cr
1 \tab 2 \tab 1 \tab ||\tab 1.0 \tab 0.2 \cr
2 \tab 0 \tab 4 \tab ||\tab 0.0 \tab 0.8
}

A cross tabulation between the z and y variables with
corresponding (column) proportion is

\tabular{rrrrrr}{
\tab 1 \tab 2 \tab ||\tab 1 \tab 2 \cr
1 \tab 1 \tab 3 \tab ||\tab 0.5 \tab 0.6 \cr
2 \tab 1 \tab 2 \tab ||\tab 0.5 \tab 0.4
}

Then, the maximum values of the proportion in each row are taken such that
they are 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, and 0.5. The new distance between categories 1 and
2 in the z variable is
\deqn{\delta_{1,2}^z = \frac{(1.0+0.8+0.6+0.5) - 2}{2} = 0.45}
The constant \eqn{2} in the formula applies because the z variable
depends on the 2 other variable distributions, i.e the x and y
variables. The new distances of each category in the
for the x and y variables can be calculated in a similar way.

Thus, the distance between objects 1 and 2 is 0.45. It is only the z
variable counted to calculate the distance between objects 1 and 2
because objects 1 and 2 have similar values in both the x and y
variables.

The \code{data} argument can be supplied with either a matrix or data frame,
in which the class of the element has to be an integer. If it is not
an integer, it will be converted to an integer class. If the \code{data}
of a variable only, a simple matching is calculated. The co-occurrence
is absent due to its dependency to the distribution of other variables
and a \code{warning} message appears.
