\title{Barplot of each cluster for numerical variables data set}
\usage{
barplotnum(dataori, clust, nc = 1, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataori}{An original data set.}

\item{clust}{A vector of cluster membership (see \strong{Details}).}

\item{nc}{A number of columns for the plot of all cluster
(see \strong{Details}).}

\item{alpha}{A numeric number to set the significant level (between 0 and 0.2).}
}
\value{
Function returns a barplot.
}
\description{
This function creates a barplot from a cluster result. A barplot
indicates the location and dispersion of each cluster. The x-axis
of the barplot is variable's mean, while the y-axis is the variable's name.
}
\details{
This is a marked barplot because some markers are added, i.e.
a significant test, a population mean for each (numerical) variable.
The significance test applies t-test between the population's mean and
cluster's mean in every variable. The alpha is set in between 0 to 20\%.
If the population mean differs to the cluster's mean, the bar shade in the
barplot also differs.

\code{clust} is a vector with the length equal to the number of objects
(\emph{n}), or the function will be an \emph{error} otherwise. \code{nc}
controls the layout (grid) of the plot. If \code{nc = 1}, the plot of each
cluster is placed in a column. When the number of clusters is 6 and
\code{nc = 2}, for example, the plot has a layout of 3-row and 2-column grids.
