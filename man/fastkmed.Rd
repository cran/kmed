\title{Simple and fast k-medoid algorithm}
\usage{
fastkmed(distdata, ncluster, iterate = 10, init = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{distdata}{A distance matrix (\emph{n x n}) or \emph{dist} object.}

\item{ncluster}{A number of clusters.}

\item{iterate}{A number of iterations for the clustering algorithm.}

\item{init}{A vector of initial objects as the cluster medoids
(\emph{see} \strong{Details}).}
}
\value{
Function returns a list of components:

\code{cluster} is the clustering memberships result.

\code{medoid} is the id medoids.

\code{minimum_distance} is the distance of all objects to their cluster
medoid.
}
\description{
This function runs the simple and fast k-medoid algorithm
proposed by Park and Jun (2009).
}
\details{
The simple and fast k-medoids, which sets a set of medoids as the
cluster centers, adapts the k-means algorithm for medoid up-dating.
The new medoids of each iteration are calculated in the within cluster
only such that it gains speed.

\code{init = NULL} is required because the Park and Jun (2009) has
a particular method to select the initial medoids.  The initial medoids
are selected by
\deqn{ v_j = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{d_{ij}}{\sum_{l=1}^n d_{il}},
\quad j = 1, 2, 3, \ldots, n }
where the first \emph{k} of the \eqn{v_j} is selected if the number of
clusters is \emph{k}.

\code{init} can be provided with a vector of id objects. The length of
the vector has to be equal to the number of clusters. However, assigning
a vector in the \code{init} argument, the algorithm is no longer the simple
and fast k-medoids algorithm. The \code{\link{inckmed}} function,
for example, defines a different method to select the initial medoid
though it applies the \code{\link{fastkmed}} function.

\examples{
num <- as.matrix(iris[,1:4])
mrwdist <- distNumeric(num, num, method = "mrw")
result <- fastkmed(mrwdist, ncluster = 3, iterate = 50)
table(result$cluster, iris[,5])
